# Admin Skeleton Dashboard

Splitted into chunks of php files. Ready to use as soon as you clone it

## Features :-

- Notification dropdown, Search Bar, Dynamic Modal.
- Thin **toggleable sidenav**.
- Custom theme and classes without breaking BS4 css.
- Completely Responsive for over **5** width ranges devices.
- Custom components without breaking BS4 css like :- button, button-border, text, input, input-border, border.

## For custom theme :-

- Editing `$primary1`, `$primary2`, `$secondary1`, `$secondary2` in `/sass/abstracts/_variables.scss` is enough, where `$primary1` is __darkest__ and `$secondary2` is *lightest* color.
- You might need [sass](https://sass-lang.com/install) to compile file into css. 
- If you have installed [python](https://www.python.org/), the `/sass.py` automaticlly finds your `/sass/main.scss` and compile it to `/main.css`. Just _double-click_ on it on _Windows_ machine.

>You may also edit `/main.css` directly to change **theme**, but you have to change color codes everywhere.
